# i need help for making the sugar rush remake

i'm making a remake of sugar rush on godot for the arcades, i stopped making the game on the early stages because of a problem, the problem is that the extraction of the 3d models of the racers is hard on blender 2.79 (cuz this blender version supports open.GL 3.1 on my computer)

heres the project
